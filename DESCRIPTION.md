# HeroCall

## Introduction
Call for Code is focused this year on solving issues caused by global warming.
There are 3 categories suggested: Clean Water and Sanitation, Zero Hunger and Responsible
Production and Green Consumption.
We have lots of ideas on lots of issues. We had to choose one specific problem. However, why
not try solve all the issues? Obviously, it is impossible to solve every problem out there.
It doesn't help that we don’t know all of them either. What if people could report their
problems? What if anyone in the world had access to these reports? What if anyone could
respond to the call for help? 
This is HeroCall; a worldwide network of heroes that help people in need.

## In depth
Our project, HeroCall does not address any one category. Instead it is premised on being able
to target all of them at the same time. Our belief is that the knowledge that humanity has acquired 
through thousands of years of innovation should be available to everyone. 
Nowadays people need not spend years studying a specific topic. They just need to get in
touch with the people that already have the knowledge.

People can make a post on a problem they have. Experts in the field, or anyone with a helpful idea,
will then read the problem and collaborate with each other to find a solution. If the proposed solution
is tested successfully by the person in need, a solution post can be created. The solution post gathers all
the instructions and resources needed to carry out the solution. This makes it easier for another
person with the same issue to solve it.
Every time a hero answers a help post, their reputation improves. This reputation adds
credibility to future posts that they make in the platform.

HeroCall is a website, which can be described as a mix between a forum and a
collaboration platform. It is similar to Quora and Stack Overflow in the sense that it allows for
people to ask a question and get an answer. HeroCall is specifically targeted for people in need.
The solution posts are similar to GitHub repositories. However, solutions are not only about
code; they’re just a set of instructions and tips to follow to solve a specific issue for which the
method has previously been successfuly tested.
In addition, there is no other platform that combines these two features in one.

In the future, we plan to demolish language barriers by automatically translating every post, comment or contribution to the language of the reader.
This key feature will make our platform stand out from all previously existing forum-type platforms.
It expands the scope of people that heroes can help from just those who speak the same language to virtually anyone in the world with an internet connection!

## Final thoughts
We are sure that HeroCall has great potential. Experts can help people in need by providing 
their knowledge and guidance. Students can add to their CV and their real-world experience during 
their free time by becoming heroes. Even people that have already received help on the platform can post 
and become a hero by sharing their knowledge with newer users.

## Conclusion
HeroCall has a lot of potential, given its wide action field. It doesn’t solve a specific issue, but it’s a
catalyst for solving many. It is very in line with the IBM Call for Code goals, and we think it is
exactly what the world needs in order to grow together as a global society.
