# HeroCall

## Introduction
Call for Code is focused this year on solving the issues of people caused by global warming.
There are 3 categories suggested: Clean water and sanitation, zero hunger and responsible
production and green consumption.
We have lots of ideas for lots of issues. We had to choose one specific problem. However, why
not solve all the issues? Realistically, it is impossible that we can solve every issue in the world,
mainly because we don’t know all of them. However, what if people could report their
problems? What if anyone in the world had access to these reports? What if anyone could
respond to the call for help? That is HeroCall. A worldwide network of heroes that help people
in need.

## In depth
HeroCall is not targeted for one of the categories. It is targeted to all of them at the same time.
Our belief is that the knowledge that humanity has acquired through thousands of years of
innovation should be available to anyone. What’s even better, people don’t need to spend
years studying about a specific topic. They just need to talk with the people that already have
the knowledge.

People can make a post of a problem they have. Experts in the field will then read the
problem and collaborate between each other to find a solution. If the solution is tested
successfully by the person in need, a solution post can be created. The solution post gathers all
the instructions and resources needed to carry out the solution. This makes easier for another
person with the same issue to solve it.
Every time a hero answers a help post, their reputation improves. This reputation adds
credibility to future posts that they make in the platform.

Our solution is a website, which can be described as a mix between a forum and a
collaboration platform. It is similar to Quora and Stack Overflow in the sense that it allows for
people to ask a question and get an answer. HeroCall is specifically targeted for people in need.
The solution posts are similar to GitHub repositories. However, solutions are not only about
code, they’re just a set of instructions and tips to follow to solve a specific issue for which the
method has been tested successful previously.
In addition, there is no other platform that combines these two features in one.

## Final thoughts
We are sure that HeroCall has a lot of potential. Experts can help people in need by providing
their knowledge and guidance. University students can improve their CV and their real-world
experience during summer by becoming heroes. Even previous people that have been helped
can post and become a hero by providing their knowledge to new users.

## Conclusion
HeroCall has a lot of potential, given its wide action field. It doesn’t solve a specific issue, but it’s the
means of solving any issue. It is very in line with the IBM Call for Code goals, and we think it is
exactly what the world needs in order to grow together as a global society.
